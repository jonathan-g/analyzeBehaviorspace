# analyzeBehaviorspace

This is a shiny app to analyze table output from NetLogo BehaviorSpace 
experiments. 

NetLogo outputs `.csv` files from BehaviorSpace runs that are very annoying to
analyze in Excel because of the limited functionality of Excel pivot tables.
This application reads in a `.csv` file from a BehaviorSpace run (use the
_table_ option for output, not _spreadsheet_) and allows the user to summarize
the output by up to two variables, and generate plots and summary tables, 
both of which can be exported.

To use the app, you need R version 3.3 or later. 

To install `analyzeBehaviorspace`, start R and type the following lines:
```
if (!require(devtools)) install.packages(devtools)
devtools::install_github('jonathan-g/analyzeBehaviorspace')
```
after you have done that once, you can run `analyzeBehaviorspace` by starting R and typing the following:
```
library(analyzeBehaviorspace)
launch_abs()
```

The app should start running, and open the `analyzeBehaviorspace` app in your web browser. When the app is running, 
load a `.csv` file containing the table output from a BehaviorSpace run. Then you will see a table of values for all 
the control and output variables at each tick of each BehaviorSpace run. You can generate summary plots and tables 
by choosing variables for the _x_ and _y_ axes and a grouping variable (if you choose a grouping variable, each 
different value of that variable will be represented by a different color in the plots).

The graph will plot the mean value of the _y_ variable for each value of the _x_ variable (grouped by each value of 
the grouping variable if one is chosen). You can select whether to show points, lines, or both, and whether to just 
show the mean values of the _y_ variable or to show error bars as well (error bars show plus and minus one standard 
deviation of the _y_ variable). 

If you check the `Summary table` box, the table will show the mean value and standard deviation of the _y_ variable for each combination of the _x_ and grouping variables.

You can download the plots (as `.png` images) and the summary table (as `.csv` files).
